<h1>Maltipoo</h1>
<br>
<p> <i> Not actually a dog breed per se, the <span> Maltipoo</span> is a popular cross of the Maltese and Poodle, known for their fun-loving and affectionate nature. Active and charming, they’ll fit into all kinds of homes: apartment or house, family with kids or elderly single.
Although these dogs sometimes have the unfortunate status of “designer breed,” you may find them in shelters and rescues. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.</i></p>
